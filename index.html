            <h4>Crew Mini-FAQ:</h4>

            <dl>
              <dt>When will applications close?</dt>
              <dd>Applications will remain open until at least
              <strong>May 1st, 2014</strong>... however, to avoid getting too many
              hopes up, we may close applications early if we feel we have more
              applications than we do positions available. So don't wait,
              <a href='http://goo.gl/WuxOAQ'>apply now</a>.</dd>

              <dt>When will I know if I've been accepted?</dt>
              <dd>Crew assignments will take place on an ongoing basis between
                <strong>April 1st</strong> and <strong>June 1st</strong>. If you
                get an assignment we will contact you by the email you provide.
                By <strong>June 1st</strong> at the latest we will send out an email
                to notify those who we weren't able to find a spot for.</dd>

              <dt>What are the requirements?</dt>
              <dd>Each crew member will be asked to work a minimum of
                <strong>12 hours</strong> throughout the festival, depending on
                level of involvement (though we always appreciate the superstars
                who go above and beyond!) In return you get <strong>free entry</strong>
                into the festival (there are no crew fees this year). We ask all
                crew to try to arrive on Thursday, if possible. Depending on
                your assignment and indicated availability, you may be asked
                to arrive or leave earlier or later.<br><br>
                While there are no crew fees, certain cells may require a
                volunteer deposit, to be refunded upon successful completion
                of work.</dd>

              <dt>What happens if I buy a ticket and then get accepted?</dt>
              <dd>If you bought a ticket and then get accepted you are welcome to
                resell the ticket, but unfortunately we can't refund it.</dd>

              <dt>First Aid</dt>
              <dd>we are always looking for <strong>First Aid</strong> crew,
                especially those with OFA level 3 or higher! If you have a valid
                first aid certification don't forget to include that in your
                application. If accepted, you will be required to provide a
                copy of your certification to your cell head.</dd>
              </dl>

              <dt>Any other questions?</dt>
              <dd> Please email
                <a href='mailto:info@entheosgathering.com'>info@entheosgathering.com</a>.
                (please do not email to apply, or to inquire about application status -
